Ignored files are usually build artifacts and machine generated files that can be derived from your repository source or should otherwise not be committed. Some common examples are:

dependency caches, such as the contents of /node_modules or /packages
compiled code, such as .o, .pyc, and .class files
build output directories, such as /bin, /out, or /target
files generated at runtime, such as .log, .lock, or .tmp
hidden system files, such as .DS_Store or Thumbs.db
personal IDE config files, such as .idea/workspace.xml
